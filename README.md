# 👋 Hi, I'm Jean

## 📝 Summary

Experienced global procurement professional (15+ years) combining deep domain expertise with modern technical skills. Recent graduate of **Harvard CS50** (computer science program widely reported to have completion rates around 1-2%), now focused on procurement technology, data analytics, and process automation.

I bridge the gap between procurement operations and technology — understanding both business problems and technical solutions.

---

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

I am actively seeking roles that combine procurement domain expertise with 
technology implementation:

### Primary Focus:
- **SAP Business Analyst** (Procurement / Supply Chain modules)
- **Procurement Systems Analyst** (SAP Ariba, Coupa, Jaggaer)
- **Power Platform Developer** (Procurement / Supply Chain automation)
- **Digital Procurement Specialist** (Analytics, dashboards, process automation)

### Why These Roles?
I want to stay deeply connected to **procurement operations** while leveraging 
technology to solve real business challenges. My goal is not to become a "pure 
developer" building generic software, but to be the **bridge between procurement 
teams and IT** — someone who understands both the pain points from 15 years of 
hands-on experience AND the technical capabilities of modern platforms.

This unique combination is rare: most SAP consultants have never worked a day 
in procurement operations, and most procurement professionals can't implement 
technical solutions themselves.

### What I Bring:
✅ 15+ years procurement operations (automotive, finance sectors)  
✅ Harvard CS50 technical foundation (Python, SQL, web development)  
✅ **Currently learning:** Power BI, Power Platform, Azure, AI agents (2026 roadmap)  
✅ Bilingual: Czech + English (fluent in international corporate environments)

### Work setup:
**📍 Location:** Vysočina, Czech Republic | Open to Remote/Hybrid

## 🚀 Current Learning Path

I am actively expanding my technical skills to bridge procurement domain expertise with modern technology platforms:

### In Progress (2026)
- 🔄 **Microsoft Power BI** – Building procurement analytics dashboards and spend visualizations (Microsoft Learn)
- 🔄 **Power Platform Fundamentals (PL-900)** – Low-code automation for procurement workflows (certification planned Q1 2026)
- 🔄 **AI & Automation** – Exploring AI agents (Copilot Studio, Azure AI) and their applications in procurement process optimization
- 📅 **Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)** – Cloud foundation for enterprise systems (planned Q2 2026)
- 📅 **SAP Ariba / S/4HANA Basics** – Understanding procurement ERP systems (planned Q2-Q3 2026)

### Why This Path?
Combining 15+ years of procurement operations expertise with modern cloud platforms creates a unique value proposition: I understand both the business problems AND the technical solutions. This is rare in the market — most SAP consultants lack procurement domain knowledge, and most procurement professionals lack technical implementation skills.

## 🔄 Career Transition: From Global Procurement to Technology

Since childhood, I have been fascinated by technology — whether exploring computers, mastering advanced software, or modifying Android operating systems (custom ROMs), HomeAssistant usage, or AI technologies nowadays. 

After 15+ years in global procurement, I realized my strongest interest lies at the intersection of business operations and technology. I was already using SQL for spend analysis, building Excel macros for automation, and designing process workflows — but lacked formal technical credentials.

**Harvard CS50** changed that. This rigorous computer science program gave me a solid foundation in:
- Programming fundamentals (C, Python, JavaScript)
- Database design and SQL optimization
- Web development and APIs
- Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving

Now I'm applying this technical foundation to procurement-specific platforms (SAP, Power BI, Power Platform) to become a **procurement technology specialist** — someone who speaks both business and tech languages fluently.

---

## 🤝 Teamwork & Collaboration

- Effective communicator in multicultural teams
- Skilled at listening, understanding, and supporting colleagues
- Experience leading cross-regional projects (EMEA, Americas, APAC)
- Adaptable and proactive in dynamic environments

I thrive in team environments and enjoy discussing ideas, learning from others, and offering help wherever I can. My professional background in global purchasing taught me to truly listen to counterparts, understand their needs, and translate business requirements into clear, actionable solutions.

Currently, I work in a multicultural and cross-regional environment, regularly collaborating with colleagues from diverse backgrounds. This experience strengthened my ability to communicate effectively, adapt to different working styles, and build consensus within international teams.

I believe these skills make me an effective communicator and collaborator, able to contribute positively to any team — whether in business or technology.
