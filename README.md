## 🔄 Career Switch: From Global Purchasing to Coding

Since childhood, I have been fascinated by technology—whether it was exploring computers, mastering advanced software usage, or later modifying and enhancing Android phone operating systems.  
After years in global purchasing, I was inspired to learn coding to better understand and shape the digital tools transforming business and our future.

My journey into programming truly began with Harvard’s CS50—a renowned and rigorous introduction to computer science. CS50 was deeply inspiring and strongly motivated me to continue learning and developing my coding skills, no matter how steep the learning curve. I am excited to contribute to projects that bridge technology and real-world operations.

## 🤝 Teamwork & Collaboration

I thrive in team environments and enjoy discussing ideas, learning from others, and offering my help wherever I can. My professional background in global purchasing has taught me to truly listen to my counterparts, understand their needs, and reformulate requirements for clear solutions.

Currently, I work in a multicultural and cross-regional environment, regularly collaborating with colleagues from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. This experience has strengthened my ability to communicate effectively, adapt to different working styles, and build consensus within international teams.

I believe these skills make me an effective communicator and collaborator, able to contribute positively to any team—whether in business or technology.
