## 📝 Summary

Experienced global purchasing professional with 15+ years of international procurement practice, now combining business expertise with modern technical skills in Python and SQL.[file:123]  
Recent graduate of Harvard’s CS50 program, focused on using automation and data analysis to replace manual Excel workflows with robust, repeatable tools.[file:123]  
I enjoy working in multicultural teams, simplifying complexity, and building practical software that solves real business problems.[file:123]

## 🎯 What I Do

I bridge procurement operations and technology:

- **Spend Analysis Automation** – turn manual Excel analysis into repeatable Python pipelines.
- **ERP/Export Data Cleanup** – handle messy CSV/Excel exports from SAP and other systems (encodings, separators, EU/US number formats).
- **Reporting & Dashboards** – build datasets and charts that support stakeholder decisions.
- **Hybrid Business–Tech Roles** – translate between business requirements and technical implementation in digital procurement and IT category management.[file:123]

I am especially interested in roles that value cross‑functional collaboration, data‑driven decision making, and digital transformation.[file:123]

## 💼 Featured Project – Procurement Spend Analyser

Automated tool for analyzing supplier spend data and generating actionable insights for procurement professionals.[file:123]  
Designed to turn raw ERP/procurement exports into a clean dataset, summary metrics, and ready‑to‑use charts.

> Time‑saving idea: replace repetitive Excel spend analysis with a repeatable Python workflow (load → clean → analyze → report → visualize → export).[file:123]

**Business impact (intended use):**

- Reduce monthly spend analysis from hours of manual work to minutes.
- Handle large annual spend across many suppliers with consistent logic.
- Support compliance and audit requests with clean, exportable datasets.
- Normalize EU/US number formats and different CSV dialects from ERP systems.

**Tech stack:**

- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Robust parsing of numbers and years (EU/US formats, CSV sniffing)
- Command‑line interface with options for separators and export format

**Repository:**  
➡️ `procurement-spend-analyzer` on GitHub (linked from my portfolio site)

## 🔄 Career Switch: From Global Purchasing to Tech

Since childhood I have been fascinated by technology – from exploring computers to modifying Android custom ROMs.[file:123]  
After many years in global purchasing, I decided to learn to code to better understand and shape the digital tools transforming business and our future.[file:123]

My journey into programming accelerated with Harvard’s CS50, a rigorous introduction to computer science that motivated me to keep learning despite the steep learning curve.[file:123]  
Today I want to apply this combination of procurement domain knowledge and coding skills to real‑world operations and digital procurement projects.[file:123]
